# PPS-for-TP53-mutant-HCC
Code and data accompanying the 'A novel signature for precise prognosis and personalized treatment prediction in TP53-mutant hepatocellular carcinoma' paper

The main code is split into 2 parts:
1. Construction of PPS model
2. Estimation of drug response in clinical samples
